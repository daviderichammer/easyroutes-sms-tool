**Date:** July 24, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0  

## Executive Summary

This project plan outlines the development of a specialized tool designed to send custom text messages to all incomplete stops on EasyRoutes delivery routes. The tool integrates with both the EasyRoutes API for route and stop data retrieval and the Twilio SMS API for message delivery. This solution addresses the operational need for real-time communication with customers whose deliveries have not yet been completed, enabling proactive customer service and improved delivery coordination.

The tool will be deployed on an Ubuntu server environment and designed as a command-line application with configuration file support, making it suitable for both manual execution and automated scheduling. The architecture emphasizes reliability, error handling, and operational transparency through comprehensive logging and dry-run capabilities.

## Project Objectives

### Primary Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to create a robust, production-ready tool that automates the process of identifying incomplete delivery stops and sending customized SMS notifications to the associated customers. This tool will eliminate the manual effort currently required to track delivery status and communicate with customers, reducing operational overhead while improving customer satisfaction through proactive communication.

The tool must seamlessly integrate with the existing EasyRoutes workflow, requiring minimal configuration and maintenance while providing maximum operational value. It should be capable of handling multiple routes simultaneously, processing large volumes of stops efficiently, and maintaining high reliability standards suitable for production deployment.

### Secondary Objectives

Secondary objectives include establishing a foundation for future enhancements such as automated scheduling, advanced message templating, delivery confirmation tracking, and integration with additional communication channels. The tool's architecture should be extensible to accommodate these future requirements without requiring significant refactoring.

Additionally, the project aims to create comprehensive documentation and operational procedures that enable easy maintenance, troubleshooting, and knowledge transfer to operational teams. This includes detailed API documentation, configuration guides, and troubleshooting procedures.

## Technical Requirements Analysis

### EasyRoutes API Integration Requirements

The EasyRoutes API integration forms the core data retrieval component of the tool. Based on the API documentation analysis [1], the tool must implement authentication using client credentials to obtain access tokens, which expire after a specified duration and require renewal. The authentication endpoint requires a POST request to `https://easyroutes.roundtrip.ai/api/2024-07/authenticate` with `clientId` and `clientSecret` parameters.

Route data retrieval will utilize the ListRoutes endpoint (`GET https://easyroutes.roundtrip.ai/api/2024-07/routes`) to fetch available routes, with support for pagination through cursor-based navigation. Each route contains comprehensive stop information accessible through the Route object's `stops` array, eliminating the need for individual stop API calls in most scenarios.

The critical component for determining incomplete stops lies in the RouteStop object's `deliveryStatus` field, which contains enumerated values including `UNKNOWN`, `DELIVERED`, `OUT_FOR_DELIVERY`, `ATTEMPTED_DELIVERY`, and `READY_FOR_DELIVERY`. Stops with any status other than `DELIVERED` are considered incomplete and require SMS notification.

Contact information for SMS delivery is contained within each RouteStop's `contact` object, which includes the phone number field formatted according to E.164 standards. The tool must validate and potentially reformat phone numbers to ensure compatibility with Twilio's SMS service requirements.

### Twilio SMS API Integration Requirements

The Twilio SMS integration leverages the Programmable Messaging API to deliver text messages to customers [2]. Authentication requires the Account SID and Auth Token provided for this project. These credentials will be stored securely in environment variables following Twilio's security best practices.

Message creation utilizes the Messages resource endpoint (`POST https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{AccountSid}/Messages.json`) with required parameters including the message body, sender phone number (Twilio number), and recipient phone number. The tool must handle Twilio's response codes and error conditions, including rate limiting, invalid phone numbers, and delivery failures.

The Python SDK approach will be implemented using the `twilio` package, which provides a high-level interface for API interactions. This approach simplifies error handling, authentication management, and response processing compared to direct HTTP requests.

### System Architecture Requirements

The tool will be implemented as a Python command-line application with a modular architecture supporting easy testing, maintenance, and future enhancements. The core components include an EasyRoutes API client, Twilio SMS client, configuration manager, logging system, and main orchestration logic.

Configuration management will utilize both environment variables for sensitive credentials and a configuration file for operational parameters such as message templates, retry policies, and logging levels. This approach balances security requirements with operational flexibility.

Error handling and logging will be implemented comprehensively to support production operations. All API interactions, message deliveries, and error conditions will be logged with appropriate detail levels. The tool will implement retry logic for transient failures and graceful degradation for non-critical errors.

## System Architecture Design

### Component Architecture

The system architecture follows a modular design pattern with clear separation of concerns between different functional areas. The main application orchestrates interactions between specialized client modules, each responsible for a specific external service integration.

The EasyRoutes client module encapsulates all interactions with the EasyRoutes API, including authentication token management, route data retrieval, and stop filtering logic. This module implements automatic token renewal, request retry logic, and comprehensive error handling for various API response scenarios.

The Twilio client module manages SMS message delivery, including phone number validation, message formatting, and delivery status tracking. This module implements rate limiting compliance, error categorization, and retry logic for failed message deliveries.

The configuration module provides centralized management of application settings, credential loading, and runtime parameter validation. This module supports both environment variable and configuration file sources, with appropriate precedence rules and validation logic.

The logging module implements structured logging with configurable output formats and levels. This module supports both console and file output, with rotation policies and integration with system logging infrastructure.

### Data Flow Architecture

The application data flow begins with configuration loading and credential validation, followed by EasyRoutes API authentication and route data retrieval. Route data is processed to identify incomplete stops, with contact information extracted and validated for SMS delivery.

SMS message generation utilizes configurable templates with dynamic content insertion based on stop-specific information such as delivery address, customer name, and estimated delivery timeframes. Message delivery is executed with appropriate error handling and retry logic.

Results tracking and logging capture all significant events, including successful message deliveries, failed attempts, and system errors. This information is structured to support operational monitoring and troubleshooting activities.

### Security Architecture

Security considerations encompass credential management, data handling, and communication security. API credentials are stored exclusively in environment variables, never in configuration files or application code. The application implements secure credential loading with validation and error handling for missing or invalid credentials.

Communication with external APIs utilizes HTTPS exclusively, with certificate validation enabled. The application does not store or cache sensitive customer information beyond the immediate processing requirements.

Logging output is designed to exclude sensitive information such as phone numbers and message content, while providing sufficient detail for operational monitoring and troubleshooting. Log rotation and retention policies will be implemented according to organizational requirements.

## Implementation Plan
